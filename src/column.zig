//! Column arithmetic for the scroll chain.
//!
//! A column is a run of consecutive tiled windows: a head with `stacked`
//! clear, followed by its members with `stacked` set. The members divide the
//! head's slot vertically instead of taking slots of their own. Floating
//! windows belong to no column and are skipped, so one sitting between two
//! tiled windows does not split their column.
//!
//! Everything here is deliberately free of wayland types and takes a plain
//! slice, so it can be tested without a compositor or generated protocol
//! bindings: `zig test src/column.zig`. The window type only has to expose
//! `is_floating` and `stacked`.
